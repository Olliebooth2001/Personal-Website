<h2>Current Undertakings</h2>
<p>I am currently a software engineering student at Sheffield Hallam thoroughly enjoying the course.I have created this website in order to hopefully demonstrate my ability to work comfortably with CSS and HTML5 in creating a functional website with an attractive design. I enjoy the whole process  of creating a website from start to finish. The design aspect is perfect for me as I am a very creative person paired with the challenge of coding in CSS so everything fits perfectly on the screen. I also spend a lot of my spare time experimenting and playing around with a range of different programming langueges to help me gain a better understanding of them. Along with my studies I have set upon myself to try and join as many activities and clubs as possible during my time at Sheffield hallam. So far I have enjoyed going to the gym and taking more time to think about my diet aswell as weekly badminton sessions. I have included a video which you can watch by clicking below of my 3 year old border terrier to demonstrate I can successfully import a video onto a web-page </p>
