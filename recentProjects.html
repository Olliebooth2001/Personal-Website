        <h2>Space Race - C++ with Raylib Graphics Library</h2>
        <p>
            This project is part of my Object-Oriented programming module and I particularly enjoyed it due to the creative freedom we were allowed and the fact it was a group assignment. The specification was relatively simple, we were to make a grid based game whichever way we liked using the concepts we had covered throughout the module . I thoroughly enjoyed working as a group and we were effective in dividing the tasks around based on each individual's skills and experience. I was tasked with implementing all of the graphics, animation and audio along with enemy shooting. Click the video below to enjoy the finished project. In this project in particular due to the current circumstances we had to rely on using features such as VS live share and I am now much more familiar with all of the functionality within GitHub.<br><br>

        <h2>Program which reads from files and constructs object-based relationships - Java (Eclipse)</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a part of my networked software development module I am currently undertaking. The task was to read data from various text files and manipulate and arrange them. One of the aspects I particularly enjoyed was that there were many ways to approach the assignment and it was our job to find the most suitable. Out the initial frustration of not being able to properly get to grips with the input reading I ended up thoroughly enjoying completing this project. This is often the case with many of my assignments, I love the process of learning new skills.<br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br>Obstacle Dash Game - C# WBS Application(VS)</h2>
        <p>I created this game over summer to keep myself busy and improve my programming skills. I chose WBS over a more familiar Windows Forms Application to push myself and make sure I was learning something new.  I also had fun using XAML alongside C# to design the games interface and am always keen to use a languege I am not especially familiar with.<br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br><br>Knight Platform Game - C# Windows Forms Application (VS)</h2>
        <p>This is another game I made over summer to go over C# and essential programming concepts. This was relatively similar to the Obstacle Dash game I made, making use of event handlers and timers to manage in game actions. I am currently still working on this game to smooth out the slightly glitchy player movements<br><br><br>
