        <h2>Space Race - C++ with Raylib Graphics Library</h2>
        <p>
            This project is part of my Object-Oriented programming module and I particularly enjoyed it due to the creative freedom we were allowed and the fact it was a group assignment. The specification was relatively simple, we were to make a grid based game whichever way we liked using the concepts we had covered throughout the module . I thoroughly enjoyed working as a group and we were effective in dividing the tasks around based on each individual's skills and experience. I was tasked with implementing all of the graphics, animation and audio along with enemy shooting. Click the video below to view the finished project. In this project in particular due to the current circumstances we had to rely on using features such as VS live share and I am now much more familiar with all of the functionality within GitHub.<br><br>

        <h2>Program which reads from files and constructs object-based relationships - Java (Eclipse)</h2>
        <p>
            This project is a part of my networked software development module I am currently undertaking. The task was to read data from various text files and manipulate and arrange them. One of the aspects I particularly enjoyed was that there were many ways to approach the assignment and it was our job to find the most suitable. Out the initial frustration of not being able to properly get to grips with the input reading I ended up thoroughly enjoying completing this project. This is often the case with many of my assignments, I love the process of learning new skills.<br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br>Holding-Page Game using JavaScript Fetch API - HTML, CSS, JavaScript(VSC)</h2>
        <p>The premise of this project was to make a holding page game similar to Google Dino. I worked within a group to create this maze escape game utilizing a Fetch API get the network status and inform the user when the network is back online. We used Cypress to test this project which was a new experience and I learned a plethora of new skills. I thoroughly enjoyed learning to use the API as well as strengthening my skills in JavaScript, so I am much more confident. I loved using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML pages, in particular the fact I could use one HTML file rather than multiple and just make various classes appear and disappear. Playing around with HTML5 Canvas was also massively enjoyable and incredibly satisfying once we managed to get the canvas view to follow the player. <br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br>Obstacle Dash Game - C# WBS Application(VS)</h2>
        <p>I created this game over summer to keep myself busy and improve my programming skills. I chose WBS over a more familiar Windows Forms Application to push myself and make sure I was learning something new.  I also had fun using XAML alongside C# to design the games interface and am always keen to use a languege I am not especially familiar with.<br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br><br>Knight Platform Game - C# Windows Forms Application (VS)</h2>
        <p>This is another game I made over summer to go over C# and essential programming concepts. This was relatively similar to the Obstacle Dash game I made, making use of event handlers and timers to manage in game actions. I am currently still working on this game to smooth out the slightly glitchy player movements<br><br><br>

        <h2><br><br><br>Noughts and Crosses Game with intelligent CPU - C++ Console Application</h2>
        <p>I made this program using a basic C++ console application with an intelligent CPU. It was initially a project I had finished in late first year however I thought I would go back and improve on it by adding </p>            <br><br><br>
